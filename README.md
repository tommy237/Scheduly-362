# Scheduly-362
for the cpsc-362 course

# Background
_Scheduly_ is a social media app that relies heavily on events, calendars, and (of course) schedules. It can allow users to add close friends, so that their profiles can display their busy schedules for the day, week, month, year, or later. This feature can help users organize their life and manage their time, since additional features enhance productivity among the social and online demographic.

# Goals
_Scheduly_ aims to support effective time management and productivity through all users, including collaboration with other social media platforms so that features from _Scheduly_ are implemented within those applications.
