# Background
_**Scheduly**_ is a social media platform that relies heavily on events, calendars, and (of course) schedules. It can allow users to add close friends, so that their profiles can display their busy schedules for the day, week, month, year, or later. This feature can help users organize their life and manage their time, since additional features enhance productivity among the social and online demographic.

No one knows how active their friends are, currently, and there's also confusion as to why they're not active at that time.

Take calling your friends as a prime example; it's normal for them to not reciprocate, and reasons of that vary with work, sleep, school, or others.

1. **Draggable Events** are a good feature; helpful for rescheduling appointments when there are problems.
2. **Integration** is another feature that's helpful, especially LinkedIn for interviews and zoom meetings. Google Calendars will also have back-to-back connection, since _Scheduly_ and it can utilize and import calendars.

# Goals

It should also be a recommended application to new users, as the features supply a simple process of setting appointments and events.
