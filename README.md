for the cpsc-362 course

# Background
_**Scheduly**_ is a social media platform that relies heavily on events, calendars, and (of course) schedules. It can allow users to add mututal friends, so that their profiles can display their busy schedules for the day, week, month, year, or later. This feature can help users organize their life and manage their time, since additional features enhance productivity among the social and online demographic.

Take calling your friends as a prime example; it's normal for them to not reciprocate, and reasons of that vary with work, sleep, school, or others. No one knows how active their friends are, currently, and there's also confusion as to why they're not active at that time. Rhethorical question, but how do people know when to connect with someone at the right time?

## Features
_**Scheduly**_ applies many features that benefit user experience.
+ **Draggable Events** are a good feature; helpful for rescheduling appointments when there are problems.
+ **\*\*Integration** is another feature that's helpful, especially LinkedIn for interviews and zoom meetings. Google Calendars will also have back-to-back connection, since _Scheduly_ and it can utilize and import calendars.
+ **Status Update** is a base feature that allows the user's activity dependent on their current schedule. Yellow, green, and red are moreso determined if the user is free, idle, currently busy, or offline. This feature was solely inspired from Discord's status colors.
   - ðŸŸ© **Online** - If the user is currently free and is using the app.
   - ðŸŸ¨ **Idle** - If user is using the app during an event/work/school/appointment.
   - â¬œ **Offline** - If the user is currently free but not using the app.
   - ðŸŸ¥ **Busy** - If the user is not using the app during an event/work/school/appointment.
+ **\*Timezone Recalibration** is a base feature to include; for mutual friends who currently have school, work at a different state or country.

## Goals
_**Scheduly**_ aims to support effective time management and productivity through all users, including collaboration with other social media platforms so that features from _Scheduly_ are implemented within those applications. It should also be a recommended application to new users, as the features supply a simple process of setting appointments and events.

\*\*We yet to aim to integrate some existing platforms such as:
+ **Facebook** - status updates
+ **Twitter/X**
+ **Snapchat**
+ **LinkedIn** - status updates, professional faculty's office hours/busy hours
+ **Google Calendar** - tasks/event imports
+ **Instagram** - status updates, birthdays, etc.
+ **Indeed** - same reason as LinkedIn
